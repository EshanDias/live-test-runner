All notable changes to Live Test Runner are documented here.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-09

### Test List Improvements

#### Features
- **Search filters to test case level** — typing in the search bar now narrows results down to
  individual test cases. Only matching suites and tests are shown within each file; if a suite name
  matches the query all of its tests are shown, otherwise only the matching tests appear
- **State preserved across tab switches** — the Start / Stop buttons, live blinking indicator, and
  watch state are now correctly restored when returning to the explorer after switching VS Code tabs.
  Search query, failures-only filter, and folder-view toggle also survive the tab switch
- **Gutter status icons** — pass ✓ / fail ✗ / running ⟳ / pending ○ icons appear next to each
  `it()` and `test()` line as soon as results arrive; cleared automatically when the session stops
- **Inline duration text** — muted duration label rendered after the closing paren of each test
  block, colour-coded green (< 100 ms) / amber (100–500 ms) / red (> 500 ms)
- **CodeLens run button** — `▶ Run` appears above each `describe`, `it`, and `test` block while a
  session is active; clicking reruns that test (or the whole file if no result exists yet)
- **CodeLens debug button** — `▷ Debug` above each block launches Jest in debug mode via
  `vscode.debug.startDebugging` with `--runInBand --no-coverage`, scoped to that test via
  `--testNamePattern`
- **Jump to results** — `◈ Results` CodeLens on `it`/`test` lines with known results; clicking
  focuses the Test Results panel and scrolls to and selects the matching row
- **Session-scoped** — CodeLens entries and gutter decorations are only visible while a session is
  active; stopping clears everything immediately

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-04

### Editor Inline Decorations

#### Features
- **Custom Test Explorer** sidebar panel with file → suite → test hierarchy
- **Live Test Results** panel (3 columns: test list, console output, errors)
- **Action bar** — Start Testing, Stop Testing, and Rerun Tests buttons
- **Live watch indicator** shown when the session is active
- **Summary bar** — total / passed / failed counts with elapsed time
- **Failures-only filter** toggle on the test list toolbar
- **Search** bar to filter the test tree by name
- **Collapse All / Expand All** toolbar buttons
- **Per-row rerun** (▶) and **open file** (↗) buttons on hover
- **Duration badges** — color-coded fast / moderate / slow at file, suite, and test level
- **Empty state** message when no tests have been discovered yet
- **Run progress** line showing file count and elapsed time during a run
- `session-started` / `session-stopped` broadcast messages for accurate UI state
- Smart Jest auto-detection: standard Jest, CRA / react-scripts, local `node_modules/.bin/jest`
- `--outputFile` temp-file capture to avoid Windows pipe-buffering data loss
- `stdout` JSON fallback for CRA runs that skip writing `--outputFile` on failure
- Concurrent file runner (up to 3 parallel Jest workers)
- Console output parsed from stderr for CRA projects that omit the `console` array in JSON

#### Internal
- `JestTestCaseResult` now carries an optional `location: { line, column }` field populated from
  Jest's `--json` output
- New `LineEntry` type and `LineMap` methods added to `ResultStore`
- New `EditorDecorationManager` class owns all `TextEditorDecorationType` instances
- New `LiveTestCodeLensProvider` class provides CodeLens via regex line scan (no AST)
- SVG gutter icons in `resources/icons/` (passed / failed / running / pending)

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-03

### Initial release

#### Features
- **Auto-detection** — automatically discovers the package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn) and Jest
  binary used by the workspace; no configuration required for standard setups
- **Live test execution** — runs Jest tests on file save and surfaces results in real time without
  waiting for the full run to finish
- **Test hierarchy in sidebar** — the VS Code Testing panel shows files, describe suites, and
  individual test cases as a collapsible tree, updated live as each file finishes
- **Status indicators** — spinning indicator while a file is running; ✓ / ✗ icons with green/red
  colouring once results arrive; pass/fail/skip counts shown at the file level
- **Durations** — per-file and per-test durations displayed inline; files taking over 3 s are
  highlighted in yellow, over 10 s in red
- **Concurrent execution** — test files run in parallel (up to the worker pool limit); the sidebar
  updates file-by-file rather than waiting for the entire suite
- **ANSI output channel** — a dedicated "Live Test Runner (ANSI)" output channel shows full Jest
  output with colours, including startup logs and the exact command invoked
- **Diagnostics** — failed tests produce red squiggles in the editor at the failing line; cleared
  automatically on the next passing run
- **Project root selection** — command to manually select the project root when auto-detection is
  insufficient (useful for monorepos)
- **Status bar** — shows current state (Off / Running… N/M / ✅ N passed / ❌ N failed) with a
  click-to-start shortcut
- **Commands**: Start Testing, Stop Testing, Run Related Tests (current file), Refresh Tests,
  Rebuild Map, Clear Diagnostics, Show Output, Select Project Root

#### Known Limitations & Bugs

- **Per-test output not shown on macOS** — clicking an individual test case in the VS Code Test
  Results panel shows *"The test case did not report any output."* on macOS. The global run output
  (visible via the "Show Results Output" button) is complete and unaffected. This is caused by
  inconsistent behaviour in the VS Code `TestRun.appendOutput()` API on macOS when a `test`
  parameter is supplied.

- **No per-test click-to-view output** — as a consequence of the above, there is currently no way
  to click a passing test and see its isolated output. Failure messages for failed tests do appear
  in the Messages tab of the Test Results panel on all platforms.

- **Monorepo support is manual** — in workspaces with multiple Jest configs the correct project
  root must be set manually via the "Select Project Root" command.

- **No coverage support** — code coverage is not yet surfaced in the UI. Planned for a future
  release.

- **Windows path edge cases** — Jest normalises file paths differently on Windows; path matching
  uses `fileResults[0]` as a workaround and may behave unexpectedly in edge cases with multiple
  Jest projects in a single config.

## Roadmap

### Future
- Coverage overlay (% per file in tree)
- Re-run a single file or single test from the custom tree
- Persistent results across window reloads
- Monorepo multi-root support
